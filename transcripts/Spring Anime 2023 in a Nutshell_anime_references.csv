Anime Title,Timestamp,Gigguk Excited?,Notes
Yuri Is My Job!,1:09,Amused/Intrigued,"Jokes about the Yuri Cafe premise, compares fans to Bocchi fans, sarcastically asks for the address."
I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World,3:09,No,"Calls it trashy wish fulfillment, a shameless power fantasy like a Dhar Mann video. Ironically implies he watched it."
My Love Story with Yamada-Kun at LV999,3:54,Mixed/Critical,"Notes return of old-school shojo, but finds the female lead a ""hot mess"" and ""cringe"". Male lead just wants to play games."
Otaku Elf,4:48,Amused,"Describes the elf as a ""neckbeard wife"" and ""gamer girl gremlin"", compares transformation to Umaru-chan."
The Dangers in My Heart,5:36,Yes,"Calls it ""genuinely cute and fluffy"" despite the dark premise (MC fantasizes about murder). Jokes about the ""I'll kill you"" line."
My Home Hero,6:15,Intrigued/Shocked,Intrigued by premise (father vs daughter's NTR-like boyfriend). Shocked/amused by the father's violence (smashing rice cooker).
Magical Girl Destroyer,6:36,Yes,"Praises it for ""unironically going this hard"". Compares it favorably to Trigger/Gainax, calls it ""Gurren Lagann with weebs""."
Mashle: Magic and Muscles,7:22,Yes,"Describes it as ""Harry Potter the boy who lifted"" (mix of OPM/Black Clover/Hogwarts). Finds it very fun, ""Giga Chad Harry""."
Dead Mount Death Play,8:02,Yes (won over),"Initially skeptical, but won over by twists (reverse isekai, final boss MC, yandere, Baccano creator). Decides to watch."
Kizuna No Allele,8:37,No,"Disappointed it wasted VTuber potential for a ""bare bones generic Idol show""."
Oshi No Ko,9:05,YES (Highest Recommendation),"MUST WATCH BLIND. Unfiltered look at entertainment industry, ""Black Mirror for influencers"". Potential to surpass Kaguya-sama."
Heavenly Delusion (Tengoku Daimakyo),10:43,Yes (Very High),"Praises fresh, mysterious post-apocalyptic setting, doesn't spoon-feed info. High production, great soundtrack. ""Dark Horse contender""."
Skip and Loafer,11:53,Yes (Feel-good),"Extremely feel-good, wholesome. Praises PA Works, homely/authentic vibes. ""Good Vibes all around""."
Insomniacs After School,12:39,Yes (Very High),"Calls vibes, writing, music ""perfect"". Genuine character chemistry, no tropes. Predicts it's the ""sleeper hit"" of the season."
Hell's Paradise,13:43,Yes (Good Fun),"Compares to Suicide Squad meets HxH Dark Continent. Expects violent, pretty, action-packed fun, though not revolutionary."
My One-Hit Kill Sister,14:44,No (but looks good?),"Identifies as ""incest bait sister isekai"". Ironically relieved to find a ""bad"" show, but confused why it looks well-produced."
The Legendary Hero is Dead!,15:13,Yes (Reluctantly),"Initially dismissive, but impressed by an action clip and reluctantly adds it to his watchlist."
KamiKatsu: Working for God in a Godless World,15:30,Intrigued,"Finds the premise (starting religion in a godless world, power based on followers) unique and interesting."
