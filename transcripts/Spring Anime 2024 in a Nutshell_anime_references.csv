Bartender: Glass of God,~2:09,Moderately Interested,"Remake of an 18-year-old ""underground"" anime. Calls it an ""absolute Vibe"" and a good ""night cap show"". Compares bartender to Sherlock Holmes."
Spice and Wolf: Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf,~2:41,Yes,"Reboot of a ""widely beloved show"" and personal favorite. Does a long Gen Z slang explanation skit. Highly recommended (""10 out of 10 gats"")."
Sound! Euphonium Season 3,~4:04,Yes,"Expressed excitement/surprise (""Kyoto animation is actually making a season 3 no""). Mentioned in sequel block."
Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Hashira Training Arc,~4:10,Neutral,Mentioned as a highly anticipated fantasy anime returning.
Laid-Back Camp Season 3 (Yuru Camp),~4:12,Yes,"Happy it's back, jokes it means the Yamanashi prefecture economy is back."
My Hero Academia Season 7,~4:15,Neutral,Notes it's now in its 7th season.
Black Butler: Public School Arc,~4:21,Surprised / Nostalgic,"Expressed surprise (""What is happening right now?"") and nostalgia (""What am I my college Years again?"")."
Gods' Games We Play,~4:30,No,"Contrasts it with No Game No Life, noting similar elements but lacking the ""uncomfortably incestuous relationship"". Implies it's not a worthy successor."
Train to the End of the World (Shuumatsu Train Doko e Iku?),~4:48,Curious / Cautious,"Calls it weird. Describes premise (7G apocalypse, animals, girls travel wasteland). Compares potential vibe to Girls' Last Tour but feels something is off, expects a dark twist. ""Strand type anime""."
Unnamed Memory,~5:18,Moderately Interested,"Premise: Old witch and Giga Chad prince breaking a curse. Expects dialog-heavy show, relies on banter/chemistry. Notes Re:Zero creator endorsement."
An Archdemon's Dilemma: How to Love Your Elf Bride,~5:47,Initial Yes -> Shocked,"Initially calls it ""adorable love story"", then reacts negatively to the ""slave and her owner"" twist."
The Fable,~6:16,Yes (Manga) / No (Anime),"Heard great things about the manga (John Wick comedy/Yakuza). Criticizes the anime adaptation as ""dullest blandest looking"", fueling ""Reed the manga"" bros."
Rinkai!,~6:42,Sarcastically Yes,Show about women's bicycle racing. Sarcastic tone implies commentary on fan service/appeal.
Whisper Me a Love Song (Sasayaku You ni Koi wo Utau),~6:54,Dismissive (briefly),"Mentioned very briefly after Rinkai!; seemed to lump it in with ""seasonal fill of crap"" initially. (Gigguk's ""W basketball"" comment seems like a joke/error)."
Kaiju No. 8,~6:58,Yes,"Calls it the ""hottest new Shonen Jump adaptation"". Praises production values (IG, music). Likes the older (32yo) protagonist. Mentions Twitter/X premiere. Compares to other ""X vs X"" shows."

A Salad Bowl of Eccentrics (Henjin no Salad Bowl),~8:33,Moderately Interested,"Reverse isekai comedy. Calls it a spiritual successor to Hinamatsuri with ""domestic terrorism"" joke. Detective + isekai princess."
Viral Hit (How to Fight),~8:59,Skeptical / Amused,Manhwa adaptation. YouTuber fights bullies. Jokes about premise being unrealistic (monetization) then finds real-world parallels believable.
Wind Breaker,~9:44,Yes (Production),"Delinquent anime. Praises CloverWorks' fight animation, calling it ""leagues above"" Tokyo Revengers. Might stick with it if production stays high. Amused by adults cheering on kid fights."
Chillin' in Another World with Level 2 Super Cheat Powers,~10:17,Sarcastically Amused,"Mocks minor variations on isekai tropes (isekai'd from *another* fantasy world, OP at level 2) as major innovation."
The Many Sides of Voice Actor Radio (Seiyuu Radio no Ura Omote),~10:35,Initial Yes -> Suspicious,"Cute girls start radio show. Initially likes the chemistry/setting, then suspects it's a disguised idol anime."
Girls Band Cry,~11:02,Cautiously Optimistic,"Full CG anime. Notes CG improvements (expressions). Willing to give it a chance due to being a sucker for rock music anime, despite CG aversion. Then realizes it's *another* idol anime."
A Condition Called Love (Hananoi-kun to Koi no Yamai),~11:41,Neutral / Observational,Shoujo romance. Notes genre resurgence and compares setup inversion to other shows. Jokes about logo.
Re:Monster,~12:06,No / Cynical,"Isekai via stabbing. MC is a goblin. Makes Goblin Slayer/Goblin Deez Nuts jokes. Calls it ""brickton isekai experience""."
I Was Reincarnated as the 7th Prince...,~12:26,Mildly Amused / Wary,OP protagonist isekai. Seems self-aware but potentially annoying (Genshin gliding joke).
As a Reincarnated Aristocrat... (Appraisal Skill),~12:41,Yes (Implied by binging),Kingdom building isekai. Compares to Slime/Realist Hero. Admits binging the source material after watching ep 1.
The New Gate,~12:54,No / Dismissive,"Isekai based on old (2013) web novel. Mocks the name and age, notes no relation to *Gate*."
Mission: Yozakura Family,~13:38,Moderately Interested,Shonen Jump adaptation. Describes as Spy x Family meets Looney Tunes Zoldyck family. Notes character archetypes.
Blue Archive The Animation,~14:00,Neutral / Curious,"Gacha game adaptation. Unfamiliar but recognizes characters/memes (""cunny""). Includes bit on character design appealing to fanbases -> vtuber avatar."
Jellyfish Can't Swim in the Night (Yoru no Kurage wa Oyogenai),~14:51,Very Yes,"High praise for this original anime. Compares feeling to A Place Further than the Universe. Loved the direction, emotional beats, characters (misfit girls). Standout of the season. Notes director."
