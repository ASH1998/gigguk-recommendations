Anime Title,Timestamp,Gigguk Excited?,Notes
Call of the Night (Yofukashi no Uta),01:00,Yes (Very),"Read manga, high praise for adaptation, atmosphere, music (lo-fi vibes), godly soundtrack. Setting the standard for the season."
Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer,03:33,No,"Aware of beloved manga status, but calls adaptation disappointing, ""room temperature beer"", ""flat"". Feels it satisfies no one."
My Isekai Life,04:10,No,"Calls it generic, ""same picture"" as author's previous work. Facetious tone about the ""strongest sage"" gimmick."
The Devil is a Part-Timer! Season 2,04:32,Yes,"Excited for its return after 9 years, ""memed into existence""."
Classroom of the Elite Season 2,04:54,Yes,Happy it's back after 5 years to resolve the cliffhanger.
Tokyo Mew Mew New,04:58,Yes (Indirectly),"Excited for his partner (Cindy) and for the potential sequel name ""Tokyo Mew Mew NuNu""."
Danmachi IV,05:15,Neutral/Mentioned,Mentioned as reaching Season 4.
Overlord IV,05:15,Yes (Hopeful),Still has high hopes despite S3 CG issues.
Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun S2,05:23,Yes,"Prepared for dark themes, praises Kevin Penkin's music highly."
Rent-a-Girlfriend Season 2,05:35,No (Sarcastic),"Laughs, heavily criticizes MC (Kazuya) as ""maidenless"", cringe. Suggests watching Call of the Night instead."
RWBY: Ice Queendom,06:13,Yes,"Praises the animation ""glow up"" by Shaft/Urobuchi. Notes Monty Oum's choreography is unmatched. Jokes about 4K cookie eating."
Engage Kiss,07:18,Mixed,"Visually good (A1 Pictures), but initially felt like a forgettable 2010s anime. Concedes it was ""alright"" after episode 3."
Kinsou no Vermeil (Vermeil in Gold),08:25,Yes (For Horni),"Describes it as ""Fate except it's really horny"", highlights fanservice elements (succubus, virgin killer sweater)."
Smile of the Arsnotoria the Animation,08:50,Neutral/Dismissive,"Briefly mentioned, calls it ""Tiny Witch Academia""."
When Will Ayumu Make His Move?,08:55,Neutral/Positive,"Calls it ""reverse Takagi-san"", a cute rom-com option."
The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting,09:00,Neutral,"Calls it cute, part of the ""daughter simulator"" genre, but feels it can't compete with Spy x Family's Anya in meme potential."
Parallel World Pharmacy (Isekai Yakkyoku),09:22,Yes (Intrigued),"Most interesting pharmacy isekai for him due to MC's powers/premise. Disappointed by the ""death by overwork"" trope again."
Uncle from Another World (Isekai Ojisan),10:22,Yes,"Calls it one of the best isekai parodies. Praises premise (post-isekai uncle becomes YouTuber), humor, characters. Fell for tsundere."
My Stepmom's Daughter Is My Ex,11:24,Neutral/Mild,"Expected more ""spice"", finds it more wholesome/bickering focused. Compares to Kaguya-sama + incest undertones. ""Casual rummage""."
Lycoris Recoil,12:16,Yes,"Praises action/gun choreography (""gun fu""). Highlights Chisato (""waifu Keanu Reeves"") as potential best girl. Seems promising."
Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World,13:03,Yes (Ironically),"Finds the slavery premise deplorable but amusingly brazen/unapologetic (""Up yours woke moralists""). ""Absolutely watching this""."
Black Summoner (Kuro no Shoukanshi),14:38,No/Dismissive,"Used as a punchline after ranting against slavery tropes in isekai, implying it also uses the trope."
