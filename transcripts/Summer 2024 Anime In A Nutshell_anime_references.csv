Wistoria: Wand & Sword,2:32,Yes,"Extremely high praise for visuals and action (""godamn hard"", ""looks absolutely phenomenal""). Questions if anything else will look as good."
Days With My Stepsister,3:41,Yes,"Surprisingly serious, grounded drama despite the premise (""zero irony... legit""). Praises atmosphere, visuals. Calls it the ""Dune of incest""."
Alya Sometimes Hides her Feelings,5:05,Yes (Qualified),"Standard cute romance premise, but willing to watch because Doga Kobo (studio) is animating it (""Doga Kobo are just so good"")."
Tower of God (Season 2),6:15,Unclear,Mentioned as returning.

Nier Automata Ver1.1A Part 2,6:21,Maybe (Hopeful),Hopes hype remains and it doesn't suffer production issues.
Fairytale 100 Years Quest,6:27,Maybe (Dismissive),"Initially questions its relevance (""Who's asking for more fairy tale?""), then softens slightly (""maybe too harsh"")."
Monogatari Series: Off & Monster Season,6:43,Yes,"Praises it as showing modern anime ""how it's done""."
The Elusive Samurai,6:52,Yes,"Visually stunning (""looks absolutely Godlike""), creative direction, potentially best-looking of the season. Notes tonal dissonance."
No Longer Allowed in Another World,8:00,Maybe (Curious),Intrigued by the audacity/weirdness of turning the author's tragic life into a wacky isekai comedy.
Suicide Squad Isekai,9:03,Maybe (Neutral),"Wild concept, seems like simple fun. Slightly underwhelmed given the writer (Re:Zero) and studio (Wit)."
My Deer Friend Nokotan,9:43,No (Confused),"Completely baffled by the premise; performs a comedic, nonsensical presentation about deer instead of describing the show."
I Parry Everything,11:01,Yes (Amused),"Amused by the simple, absurd premise (parrying everything); appreciates the non-standard protagonist design."
Plus-sized Elf,12:02,Maybe (Amused),"Focuses on fan service (""entire baking industry""); jokes about ""American representation""."

Dahlia In Bloom,12:28,Yes,Impressed by the concept of fantasy engineering and how it made the topic look fun.
The Ossan Newbie Adventurer,12:41,No,Mocks the premise as generic OP fantasy with an older MC; finds the attempt at relatability misguided/offensive.

Senapi is an Otonoko,14:07,Unclear,Describes the crossdressing premise; makes a joke about Astolfo fans.

Pseudo Harem,15:19,Maybe (Amused),"Amused by the novelty/absurdity of the ""one girl is the whole harem"" idea (""weaponized schizophrenia"")."
2.5 Dimensional Seduction,16:13,Maybe (Sarcastic),Frames it as extreme power fantasy/wish fulfillment for weebs; sarcastically compares its power level to isekai.
