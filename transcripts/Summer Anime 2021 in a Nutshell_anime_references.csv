Anime Title,Timestamp,Gigguk Excited?,Notes
Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid S (Season 2),~0:41,Yes,KyoAni's return after tragedy. Praises the high-quality fight scene. Sequel.
Peach Boy Riverside,~2:33,No,"Calls it an ""edgy mess"". Brutal violence, protagonist excuses murder because the killer is cute. Gigguk mistakenly calls it an Isekai initially."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime S2 P2,~3:20,Yes (Implied),"Continuation. Notes it's ""kicking off"" and implies viewers should catch up."
Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy,~3:33,Maybe,"Calls it a ""pretty strong attempt"" at self-aware isekai. Protagonist deemed ugly, gets language power."
Drugstore in Another World,~4:00,No,"Mocks the straightforward premise. Jokes about ""Nandos in another world""."
How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom,~4:11,Maybe/Yes,"Calls it ""actually alright"". Focuses on politics/economics, no OP protagonist. Compares it to ""Slime without the slime""."
Life Lessons with Uramichi Oniisan,~4:36,Maybe,"""I'm on the fence"". Likes the cynical comedy concept but unsure if it can stay fresh for a whole season."
Sonny Boy,~5:13,Yes,"Calls it the ""one show to look up for"". Anime Original by Shingo Natsume. Unique visuals, Lord of the Flies feel, high potential."
The Detective Is Already Dead,~6:11,No/Maybe,"Finds it ""pretty whelming"". Criticizes convoluted deduction and ""bland ass dialogue"". Will give it a few more episodes."
The Case Study of Vanitas,~7:16,Maybe/Uncertain,"Notes Studio Bones visuals & Yuki Kajiura music, but isn't hooked by vampires/setting/characters yet. ""Wait and see""."
RE-MAIN,~7:36,No (Joke),"Water polo anime. Describes it dismissively as ""Kuroko but wet""."
The Aquatope on White Sand,~7:53,Maybe,Praises the visuals as beautiful (PA Works). Wary due to PA Works' inconsistent track record (gorgeous but potentially empty shows).
Remake Our Life!,~8:21,Maybe,"Finds the time-travel-to-art-school concept ""interesting"", though questions the protagonist's choices."
"Girlfriend, Girlfriend",~8:59,Yes (Ironically),"Finds the absurd premise (guy dating two girls with permission) funny. ""Shouldn't work but it does"". ""Turn your brain off fun""."
The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!,~10:00,Yes (Initially) -> No,"Initially hyped (""Milf Nagatoro"", ""perfection""). Extreme disappointment upon realizing Jahy often appears as a loli."
